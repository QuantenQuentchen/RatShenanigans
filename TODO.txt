Commands (easy):
    -Buy Stocks (Use discord.Autocomplete, for Option) (Could be done via View but due to DC Limits would be better to have a command) (Did that)
    -Sell Stocks (Use discord.Autocomplete, for Option) (Could be done via View but due to DC Limits would be better to have a command) (Did that)
    -List My Stocks (I just thought about it, add a bought at field (maybe would be good UI but not necessary)) (Did that)
    -Found Company (Stocks value will always be /100.000 of input Value input Value > 100.000, and Name etc.)

        -Prod DB Modification
        -Prod DB Migration
    ))) Only really applicable if companies are founded by users

Never tested:
    -Vote retry system

To do (mid):
    -Use existing DBs for Constitution modifications
    -Add Qualified vote for Constitution modifications (Would need to add a DB to track pending changes (no wait have that already))
    -Config Saves (new table or new DB) (I think I have done that already)

To do (hard):
    -Agnostecize the bot (Make it so that it can be used by multiple servers)
    -Add emergecy Commands for everyone (or just Admins hehe) (auch eigentlich sack einfach aber brauch nen wenig Docs lesen)

To do (impossible):
    -Prey weiter spielen
    -fix sleep scheduel
